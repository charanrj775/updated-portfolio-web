              In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma
              International, as the starting point for a standard specification
              that all browser vendors could conform to. This led to the
              official release of the first ECMAScript language specification in
              June 1997.

              Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming
              language that is designed to have as few implementation
              dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming
              language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere
              (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all
              platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[18]
              Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run
              on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying
              computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++,
              but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.

            <p>
              Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
              describing the presentation of a document written in a markup
              language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG,
              MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World
              Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2] CSS is designed to
              enable the separation of presentation and content, including
              layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content
              accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
              specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web
              pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
              separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the
              structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to
              improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file
              and its formatting.
